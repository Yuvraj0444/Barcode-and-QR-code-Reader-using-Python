# Barcode-and-QR-code-Reader-Using-Python
# Description
Barcodes and QR codes are very cool and interesting because they store information in a different format. The fun part about them is that we can’t tell what they are storing until we analyze them. It’s like playing a puzzle game. And another thing I love about them is that they can be part of the physical world and still connect us to the internet world.
